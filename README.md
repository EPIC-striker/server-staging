# LVP Staging Server
Before changes to the gamemode will be rolled out to the live server, they should be tested on the staging server: a public Las Venturas Playground server running on a separate database with additional debugging and testing commands enabled.

## Joining the staging server
The staging server is available by connecting to `play.sa-mp.nl` on port `7778` using your SA-MP client. There is no password.
